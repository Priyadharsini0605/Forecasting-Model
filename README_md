# Stock Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using three approaches:
1. Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA.
2. Deep Learning with LSTM.
3. Regression-based prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used is historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL), sourced from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.

### Features:
- **Open, High, Low, Close**: Daily stock prices.
- **Volume**: The number of shares traded each day.
- **Moving Averages & Volatility**: Derived features for regression-based prediction.

## Models Used
### 1. ARIMA
- **ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)** is a time series forecasting model.
- It models the stock price using historical trends and seasonality.
- Forecasts are made for the next 30 days.

### 2. LSTM
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** is a recurrent neural network suitable for sequence modeling.
- Historical closing prices are used to predict future values.

### 3. Linear Regression
- Uses features like moving averages and volatility to predict stock prices.

## Results
### ARIMA Forecast:
- The ARIMA model provides stable forecasts based on historical data.
- **Visualization**:

### LSTM:
- LSTM shows convergence during training, but the model predictions require additional tuning.
- Training Loss: Gradual reduction over 10 epochs.
- **Visualization**:

### Regression:
- Linear regression provides predictions based on engineered features (e.g., moving averages).
- RMSE: **0.00** (This result indicates scaling issues in the dataset that need correction).
